# Tp_sockets

## This is a simple Chat app which implements sockets.

## I've made following a tutorial on internet.

To run this chat you'll need node js to run the file test_server.js

You can download here

For windows:
```
https://nodejs.org/en/
```

For linux:
```
 -$ sudo apt install nodejs
 -$ sudo apt install npm
```

Run the test_server.js on the terminal
```
node test_server.js
```

Go to your web browser at:
```
localhost:8080
``` 

and enjoy!!!

I'd like to add more features to this simple proyect in the future.
